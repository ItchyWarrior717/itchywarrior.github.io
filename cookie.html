        <h1>Google's false ads + dying activity</h1>
        <hr>
        In recent days, the GonerWORLD community has realised why Google is just a sketchy knockoff of Goner.lol. Stolen message log, stolen colors, etc. Google even pretends to have made the Wind on google theme, even though everyone knows Goner.lol is the first server with a Wind on google theme. <b>Google's userbase has been moving to Goner.lol because Goner.lol stands for freedom</b>. Google gives promises like "our popes are the friendliest", even though their popes are trolls (kernegg, misoneme, combine gaming, etc) who were given their pope status only because they hate Goner.lol. <b>Google is ironically run by hate</b>.<br><br>
        Google's userbase quitting Google just proves <b>our news articles are true.</b> Why else would they leave Google? Goner.lol stands for freedom, no rules, while Google <b>pretends</b> that they have no rules, despite banning people for something as small as swearing. Not to mention their popes being trolls, punishing innocent people. We should all be glad that Seamus' dictatorship is falling once again. <b>Google admins had to BRIBE users to use their website by giving away pope.</b><br><br><b>Seamus is at war with the GonerWORLD community</b>. Together we can defeat him. While he's falling, let's deal a final blow and spread all this information, so every single BW user knows about his actions.

        Sidenote: Google is pretending their Assistant and chromelaptop managment function (used for malware injection) is new. This function was caught being used only 2 days ago, <b>SO IT'S NOT new</b>.
